# nstd

This is meant to be a better C standard library with the following goals:
- easier to use
- safer (thread safety, memory safety, integer conversion safety)
- utilities developers usualy re-implement several times in their own lifetime

The `n` in nstd means `not`, because this is not THE C standard library and
never will be. It's a bad name I know ðŸ¤·
